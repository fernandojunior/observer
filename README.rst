Observer

A observer pattern implementation in Python.
--------------------------------------------

The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called
the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies
them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their
methods [#]_.

The *observer.py* implementation has a topic-based system, a message filtering
type of the publishâ€“subscribe pattern (an observer pattern variation) [#]_.
Therefore, a subject can be subdivided into topics and observers can express
interest in one (or more) topic and only receive notifications (with any
message or not) from that. For now, a subject topic can be watched only by an
observer.

A simpler implementation of the pattern can be found at *observer.old.py*.
